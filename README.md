  My first Gatsby Project
</h1>
This is a simple blog website created with the Gatsby's default boilerplate. <br />
The single posts are queried with GraphQL from markdown files.
<br />
<br />

*The development of this page is still in progress.*

## Technologies
* Gatsby
* CSS Modules
* GraphQL
* Netlify deployed

## New stuff I have learned from this project
* Creating a website with Gatsby (default boilerplate)
* Querying data from markdown files with GraphQL
* Npm modules: ```gatsby-source-filesystem``` (allows us to work with data from our computer's filesystem) & ```gatsby-transformer-remark``` (transforms markdown into HTML)
* Styling components with CSS Modules
* Deploying to Netlify
* There is a pretty cool browser tool called GraphiQL that helps to structure GraphQL queries. It can be accessed in the browser while the websites development server is running. ```http://localhost:8000/___graphql```
* I can use HTML & CSS in markdown

### ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è-Moments
* Typos in CSS class names
* VS-Code auto-completing CSS properties with the wrong property (It put ```background-color``` instead of ```background```. Took me a wee while to find...)
