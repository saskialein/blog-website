  My first Gatsby Project
</h1>
This is a simple blog website created with Gatsby's default boilerplate. <br />
The single posts are queried with GraphQL from markdown files.
<br />
<br />

*The development of this page is still in progress.*

## Technologies
* Gatsby
* CSS Modules
* GraphQL
* OpenWeatherAPI
* Netlify deployed

## New stuff I have learned from this project
* Creating a website with Gatsby (default boilerplate)
* Querying data from markdown files with GraphQL
* Npm modules: ```gatsby-source-filesystem``` (allows us to work with data from our computer's filesystem) & ```gatsby-transformer-remark``` (transforms markdown into HTML)
* Calling data from OpenWeatherAPI and returning it on my website (using SuperAgent)
* Styling components with CSS Modules
* Deploying to Netlify (with an external API call using an API Key)
* There is a pretty cool browser tool called GraphiQL that helps to structure GraphQL queries. It can be accessed in the browser while the websites development server is running. ```http://localhost:8000/___graphql```
* I can use HTML & CSS in markdown
* UI trend: Glassmorphism
* Creating my own Avatar with the [avataaars generator](https://getavataaars.com)

### ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è-Moments
* Typos in CSS class names
* VS-Code auto-completing CSS properties with the wrong property (It put ```background-color``` instead of ```background```. Took me a wee while to find...)
* Accidentally exposed my API Key on my GitHub account because I coded until late and got very tired
